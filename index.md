I am a San Francisco based Software Engineer who likes to build things, mostly scalable backend and platform services. I'm interested in distributed systems, cloud infrastructure and system security.

Currently, I'm an engineer at Salesforce focusing on Service Protection for various applications and services running on Salesforce infrastructure.

I intend to maintain a blog here to discover and share with my readers new technologies and best practices that I learn over time. You can reach me at irtazahaider05@gmail.com
